      "25  In this problem, the key point to focus on is the input array being sorted. As far as duplicate elements are concerned, what is their positioning in the array when the given array is sorted? Look at the image above for the answer. If we know the position of one of the elements, do we also know the positioning of all the duplicate elements? We need to modify the array in-place and the size of the final array would potentially be smaller than the size of the input array. So, we ought to use a two-pointer approach here. One, that would keep track of the current element in the original array and another one for just the unique elements. Essentially, once an element is encountered, you simply need to bypass its duplicates and move on to the next unique element.   \n",

      "25  The provided Python code defines a function `removeDuplicates` that removes duplicates from a sorted array `nums` in-place and returns the new length of the array after duplicates have been removed. The function uses a two-pointer technique to achieve this. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\\n\\n1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 immediately, as there are no elements to process.\\n2. It initializes a pointer `i` to 0. This pointer keeps track of the position of the last unique element found in the array.\\n3. The function then iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1) using a for loop with another pointer `j`.\\n4. Inside the loop, it compares the current element `nums[j]` with the element at the position `i` (`nums[i]`). If they are different, it means a new unique element has been found.\\n5. When a new unique element is found, the pointer `i` is incremented, and the new unique element `nums[j]` is placed at the position `i` in the array.\\n6. After the loop completes, the function returns `i + 1`, which represents the number of unique elements in the array.   \n",

Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.\\n\\nConsider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\\n\\n*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.\\n*   Return `k`.\\n\\n**Custom Judge:**\\n\\nThe judge will test your solution with the following code:\\n\\nint\\[\\] nums = \\[...\\]; // Input array\\nint\\[\\] expectedNums = \\[...\\]; // The expected answer with correct length\\n\\nint k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation\\n\\nassert k == expectedNums.length;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n    assert nums\\[i\\] == expectedNums\\[i\\];\\n}\\n\\nIf all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.\\n\\n**Example 1:**\\n\\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,1,2\\]\\n**Output:** 2, nums = \\[1,2,\\_\\]\\n**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.\\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\\n\\n**Example 2:**\\n\\n**Input:** nums = \\[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\\]\\n**Output:** 5, nums = \\[0,1,2,3,4,\\_,\\_,\\_,\\_,\\_\\]\\n**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\\n\\n**Constraints:**\\n\\n*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`\\n*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`\\n*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.\\n\\nSolution: \\n```python\\ndef removeDuplicates(nums):\\n    if not nums: return 0\\n    i = 0\\n    for j in range(1, len(nums)):\\n        if nums[j] != nums[i]:\\n            i += 1\\n            nums[i] = nums[j]\\n    return i + 1\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease provide a python file with test cases for the solution. \\nInclude the solution in the beginning of the python file exactly as provided above and refer to it in the test cases. \\nThe python file when run should execute all test cases. \\nONLY provide a VALID python file.   \n",
